title: Ballarat Hackerspace is Now Open!
tags: space

At the space we are busily putting together bits and pieces for the space to give you seating room and access to internet and equipment such as the 3D printer, soldering station, oscilloscope, dmm, monitors, keyboards, etc. While we are doing that, it makes sense that this months theme is "Hack the Space" as we get ready for more people to come into our community space.

You could say it is getting _exciting_!

### Memberships are now open

We are proud to officially open the Ballarat Hackerspace for membership. Memberships help keep the hackerspace open, power running, packets flowing, equipment working and be a useful resource for the community. All of the membership fees go into keeping the hackerspace a friendly and useful resource for all of us.

Your first option is to be an association member which gives you voting rights for the committee, attendance to association meetings and of course access to the space during our open meetings on the 1st, 3rd and 5th Tuesdays of each month at 7pm. This type of membership allows you to help shape the future of the Ballarat hackerspace with your voice and ideas and we hope that all hackerspace users would like to be this involved. The cost for this is $50 a year.

You can also choose to be a workshop member which entitles you to use the hackerspace whenever it’s open. We endeavour to ensure the hackerspace is open for at least 14 hours a week with friendly members around to help with any questions and to offer help and training using any of the equipment in the hackerspace. Initially the hackerspace will be available every week on Mondays (18:00 to 21:00), Tuesdays (16:00 to 19:00) and Saturdays (09:00 to 15:00). Open time and scheduled events are also
listed on the site; [http://bhack.in/#when](http://bhack.in/#when)

The existing 1st, 3rd and 5th Tuesdays of each month 7pm to 9pm meetings will continue to be open to anyone and as a workshop member you can of course still use this time to hack but do expect some possible interruptions by visitors to the space during this time period (especially if you’re working on something interesting :))
Membership dues are paid monthly and we are taking expressions of interest for a “pay as you go” daily rate as a future option (feel free to discuss this with us in the space or via the [Google+ community](http://plus.bhack.in)).
