It has been a whirlwind six months since our first Ballarat Hackerspace (bHack) meeting in November 2013, and we've met some fanastic people in that time that have a passion for building things. We have also established a nice little core of regulars that continue to attend every meeting with exciting projects to share and contribute to.

So, over the past few months we've been doing the necessary ground work for our little association to engage the wider community, formalise the association in order to enable more support/sponsorhip avenues and march towards it's own permanent space.

bHack will be holding a public meeting to incorporate our association at 7.00pm on Thursday, 12 June 2014 at the Pilates Ballarat Studio located at 113 Albert Street, Sebastopol.

We would like to thank everyone for their support to date and look forward to building a bigger and stronger community ahead.

Looking forward to seeing you then.
