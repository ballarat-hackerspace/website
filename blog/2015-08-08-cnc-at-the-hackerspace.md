<!-- Was just looking at a narrow starter template kind of layout. -->

  <h1>Whats new in the space this week? </h1>

  <h2>We have a CNC!</h2>

  <p class="lead">The week has been productive, with a CNC becoming operational. Controlled by a PC, this gives precise cutting and routing of objects. </p>


  <p>The objects you can use include plastic, and wood (seen here on the first functional test print). It moves at a decent pace, with the drill cutting into the wood easily. </p>

      <p>The next step is to work on the accuracy of the CNC. This will mean more calibrations, and more test prints! One of the goals is to use this with printing some of the parts needed in building 3D Printers.</p>
      <p>Like any hobby project, there was trouble with being able to talk to the CNC - After sourcing the parts needed, we have been getting more success and win.</p>

   <p> It's great to see new equipment working at the space, and brainstorming how it can be used with old and new projects.</p>

   <p>In a future post, we will have a look at how the Drone/Multi-copters are going - 3D Printed frames and all kinds of fun are happening there!</p>
