Here's the link to the [recorded audio](http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2014/06/10/4022266.htm) of Scott filling in on Tech Talk and talking about all things "hacking".

> "In the world of computers and IT the word "hacking" doesn't mean something dark or illegal. Hacking simply means getting into a device to either fix it, or make it more useful. Scott Weston, who was filling in on Techtalk, is a local IT identity who admits to regularly hacking devices."

A fantastic dialogue that hopefully piques the interest of the community.

See you at the incorporation meeting.
