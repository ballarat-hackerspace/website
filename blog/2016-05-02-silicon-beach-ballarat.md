Silicon Beach events are run to bring the Australian
technology community together. Ballarat is the latest
town to get a Silicon Beach movement. The group has only
just been formed and will be having their first meetup
soon so if you're in the tech startup scene or looking to
join it we would highly recommend joining the [meetup
group](https://meetup.com/Ballarat-Silicon-Beach) so that
you don't miss the first meeting.
