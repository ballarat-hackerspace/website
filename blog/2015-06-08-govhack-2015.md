The Ballarat teams had a bumper year in 2014, pulling in some major coinage. Of course the Ballarat Hackerspace was there in full force and we're going back again for another round. The competition starts on Friday, 3 July 2015 at 5:30 PM and wraps up with all entries to be submitted by Sunday, 5 July 2015 at 5:00 PM. As I saide *almost* 48 hours.

We'll also have the Hackerspace open and accessible to all GovHack participants for the entire duration of the competition. So if you have any hardware related entries then 

Whilst there's still plenty of time to [register](http://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/govhack-ballarat-2015-registration-16969618586), make sure you do it quickly to ensure the Ballarat organisers can cater for any special requirements you may have. Feel free to jump in on the the Ballarat Hackerspace team and be part of a great challenge. And if you are registered and planning on joining the Hackerspace team then make sure to let us know so we can sort out some schwag!
