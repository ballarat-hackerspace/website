The [Ballarat Amateur Radio Group](http://www.barg.org.au) are holding their annual [Hamvention](http://www.barg.org.au/hamvention.htm) event at the Ballarat Greyhound Racing Club on Sunday, 19th of October.

The Ballarat Hackerspace crew will be manning our first, very own, public display and will also be putting together our first group hack. Our initial design brief is "Twitter-controlled slot car racing". That's it. Sounds like something you want to be part of? Perhaps add your own flavour to it? We know it is going to be a fun build and the more the merrier.

We will also have some other goodies that we're playing with at the hackerspace. However, you'll have to come to a meeting or search us out on the day to find out. We hope to see you there.
