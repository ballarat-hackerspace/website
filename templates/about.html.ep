        <p>The Ballarat Hackerspace is a community-run non-profit organisation that supports and encourages Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) culture in the Ballarat and surrounding regions in Victoria, Australia.</p>
        <p>These ideas are promoted through engagement with the broader community, partnerships with other institutions (government, commercial, non-profit) and to anyone with an interest.</p>
        <p>We provide a workshop, available to members, with facilities and equipment for projects including 3D printing, electronics, soldering, prototyping, and programming.
        Our members pursue various constructive activities, and the Ballarat Hackerspace aims to suport them as best it can.
        We also support some destructive activities, in the name of learning.</p>
        <p>The Ballarat Hackerspace is modelled on an <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/">international movement of like-minded communities</a> that started in Germany back in 1995. Our philosophy is the idea that you should make, create, build, hack, develop and learn about how the world works, how the technology around us works and anything else related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">"the ultimate question"</a>.</p>
        <p>Our members learn skills that expand their ability, increase employability (in an ever-changing world) and express themselves through their craft.</p>
        <p>The Ballarat Hackerspace is actively inclusive, with firm and binding community rules and a <a href="#the_code">code of conduct</a> centred around being excellent to each other. Our commitment to inclusiveness is shown through ventures such as our <a href="/women">Women's Wednesdays</a>, which encourages women and their supporters to use the space for free on Wednesday nights.</p>
        <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/ballarat-hackerspace/association">Association Rules</a> are publicly available, if formalities are your thing.</a>

        <p>We have a new space!</p>

        <p>In July 2018, we moved into our new space on Albert St. We are now in the Tech School building, with entrance via the South-side of the building (up the stairs). For disabled access, there is a lift at the footpath on the South-East corner. It is secured, so just ping us on slack if you need us to let you in (if you can, gives us a day's warning that you will need it - it's fine if you don't, but this makes it easier to manage).</p>

        <p>Please come along and check us out at our next meetup, or any time we are open. <b>Right now</b>, for July 2018, access outside of hours is a little tricky (we are working on this as a priority). If you plan on visiting outside opening times, please just contact us with at least a day's warning and we can sort something out. Scroll up a little to checkout our opening times (or <a href="#timetable">click here</a>).</p>

        <p>Join the Ballarat Hackerspace to be part of our active and growing community. Casual members can use the space's equipment and facilities during opening hours. Full time members can get 24-7 access to the space (with committee approval).</p>

        <p>You are also welcome to join the <a href="/contact#slack">Slack</a>, or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/bHackerspace">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/106879016585907671427">Google+</a></p>

        <h3>Before visiting the space</h3>
