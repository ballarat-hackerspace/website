      <h2>Build your own 3D Printer Workshop</h2>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8">
          <h3>Why Build Your Own?</h3>
          <p>3D Printers allow you to print objects, allowing you to design and build new custom built objects.</p>
          <p>You can print your own tools and toys, learn to work with open source hardware, improve upon publicly available designs, and learn about one of the biggest trends for future development.</p>
          <p>There are over 100,000 items you can print right now on design-sharing website Thingiverse – all free and able to be customised!</p>
          <p>If you have ever wanted to get into 3D printing, now is your chance. The Ballarat Hackerspace is presenting a workshop, with all of the necessary components, for you to build your own 3D printer.</p>

      <h4>Why build one with your own hands, in our workshop?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>People who assemble 3D Printers have much greater printing success vs people who buy complete units.</li>
        <li>You can understand the inner workings of the machines, allowing for easier debugging and customisation.</li>
        <li>You’ll learn about Open Hardware and Open Software, and where to find help.</li>
        <li>You can make it the way YOU want it – change the hardware, re-write the software, etc. It will never be obsolete.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why the Prusa i3 Printer?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s one of the easiest to assemble, using 80% fewer parts than prior versions.</li>
        <li>It’s open source – upgrades / improved parts for it can (and are) made for it by anyone.</li>
        <li>It’s easily portable and prints great!</li>
        <li>The build area is 200mm x 200mm x 180mm – bigger than a lot of other printers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What’s included?</h3>
      <p>Our workshops include everything needed to complete your Prusa i3 RepRap printer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hardware (rods, bearings, rails, etc), complete electronics and heated build platform.</li>
        <li>Assembly Manual (digital video), and tools for maintaining your printer.</li>
        <li>Basic supplies to get you started in printing (plastic, blue tape, etc)</li>
        <li>A USB flash drive with the software you’ll need, a PDF copy of the manual, and sample files to print</li>
        <li>6 months membership to the Ballarat Hackerspace (existing members will be credited)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We’re building printers the way we like them and not using the cheapest available pieces like some eBay kits are. The printer is an open source design that allows you to easily modify and upgrade to your personal preference.</p>

      <h3>What’s the Cost:</h3>
      <p>The total cost for the course is $900, discounted to $750 for members.</p>
      <p>There is a minimum deposit of $256 to secure your position in the workshop which is refundable up to 7 days before commencement of the first workshop session.</p>

      <h3>Class Size:</h3>
      <p>Classes are currently limited to 6 printers at a time.</p>
      <p>Groups of two people are fine to work on each printer if necessary, but no larger due to space constraints.</p>

      <h3>Running Time:</h3>
      <p>The dedicated assembly classes will run on Wednesday nights from 6pm to 8.30pm. Granted that you receive membership to the Hackerspace for 6 months means that you use any other open times to complete your printer sooner. Total assembly time is approximately 12-16 hours (4 or 5 dedicated workshop sessions), you may finish sooner if you forge ahead.</p>

      <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
      <p>All participants are encouraged to bring a laptop if they own one so that they can install the software and test it. If you don’t have a laptop that’s fine, you’ll be able to bring the software home and install it, and we’ll use one of our laptops to test it in class.</p>
      <p>Assembling these printers requires use of basic tools and software. All tools are provided.</p>

      <h4>Important Note:</h4>
      <p>Working with some of these tools (soldering irons, hobby knives, etc) presents a limited opportunity for injury. Participants will be shown how to complete the build safely, but should know that they’re responsible for their own safety.</p>
