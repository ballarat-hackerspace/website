      <p>The Ballarat Hackerspace depends on financial contributions from members to pay for the facilities it provides; and volunteer hours to keep the space maintained. Joining Ballarat Hackerspace involves filling in a sign up form to our TidyClub account and agreeing to our community rules &amp; guidelines.</p>
      <p>For those who are able, we ask that you join as a Workshop Member to contribute to the running costs and get the most out of the space. Currently most people pay via scheduled payment through their online banking. We will soon have online payment processing to make life a little easier. There are also donation boxes in the space if regular payments are difficult for you.</p>
      <p>Ballarat Hackerspace also recognises and highly values the non-fiscal contributions of our members through working bees; administrative tasks; and providing a clean, safe and welcoming environment for members and guests.</p>
